/// The 20 levels. Difficulty climbs on four axes: board size, arrow count,
/// arrow length (long runs cross many exit paths) and how few arrows are
/// playable at once (`openMoves` — the generator keeps the choice that
/// narrow, so from the middle of the game on the player has to hunt for the
/// next move). The curve is steep on purpose — a handful of arrows to learn
/// on, ~60 by level 8, ~145 by the finale — and the clock scales with the
/// arrow count: about 4.5 s an arrow on the learning levels, 5.5 s in the
/// middle and 6.5 s from level 10 (plus 45 s of slack), since those boards
/// are meant to be thought about, not raced.
